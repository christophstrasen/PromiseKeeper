description=PromiseKeeper - Situation-to-action orchestration for Project Zomboid (Build 42)

NOT TESTED IN MULTIPLAYER. DON'T USE THERE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. thx.

PromiseKeeper is a persistence-first library for mid-level Lua mod developers.
It listens for situations from your sources (WorldObserver streams or Events.*),
runs actions according to your policy, and remembers progress across reloads.

Use it for things like:
- run an action once per square/zombie/player (even after reload)
- deterministic chance, cooldown, retries, and clear "why not" diagnostics
- clean separation between sensing (situations) and acting (actions)

This is a developer library, not gameplay content. It does nothing on its own.
