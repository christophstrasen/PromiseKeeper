title=[42SP] PromiseKeeper
description=PromiseKeeper - Situation-to-action orchestration for Project Zomboid (Build 42, Single Player)
description=
description=NOT TESTED IN MULTIPLAYER. DON'T USE THERE. thx.
description=
description=It listens for situations from your sources (WorldObserver streams or Events.*),
description=runs actions according to your policy, and remembers progress across reloads.
description=
description=This is a developer library, not gameplay content. It does nothing on its own.
description=
description=Try out PromiseKeeper when you need:
description=
description=- “run this action once per <player/square/zombie/...>, even after reload”.
description=- a small policy surface (max runs, deterministic chance, cooldown, retry delay).
description=- to pair **WorldObserver** (sensing) with persisted actions.
description=
description=Don’t use it when:
description=
description=- Your logic is purely local and ephemeral (no persistence needed; a direct event handler is enough).
description=- You don't like "framework-y" or declarative coding conventions.
description=- You need tested multiplayer guarantees.
