description=PromiseKeeper - Situation-to-action orchestration for Project Zomboid (Build 42, Single Player)

NOT TESTED IN MULTIPLAYER. DON'T USE THERE. thx.

PromiseKeeper is a persistence-first library for mid-level Lua mod developers.
It listens for situations from your sources (WorldObserver streams or Events.*),
runs actions according to your policy, and remembers progress across reloads.

This is a developer library, not gameplay content. It does nothing on its own.

Try out PromiseKeeper when you need:

- “run this action once per <player/square/zombie/...>, even after reload”.
- a small policy surface (max runs, deterministic chance, cooldown, retry delay).
- to pair **WorldObserver** (sensing) with persisted actions.

Don’t use it when:

- Your logic is purely local and ephemeral (no persistence needed; a direct event handler is enough).
- You don't like "framework-y" or declarative coding conventions.
- You need tested multiplayer guarantees.
