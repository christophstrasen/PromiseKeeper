# PromiseKeeper — Docs

PromiseKeeper helps you run actions at the right time, only as often as intended, and remembers across game reloads.

Pick a path:
- **Standalone (events):** your “situations” come from `Events.*` or Starlit `LuaEvent`.
- **With WorldObserver:** your situations come from `WorldObserver.situations` (recommended when you already use WO for sensing).

Start here:
- `quickstart.md`

Then:
- Concepts: `concepts/mental_model.md`, `concepts/ids.md`, `concepts/glossary.md`
- Guides: `guides/occurrance_key.md`, `guides/policy.md`, `guides/lifecycle.md`, `guides/events.md`, `guides/worldobserver.md`, `guides/persistence.md`
- Troubleshooting: `guides/troubleshooting.md`
- Reference: `reference/api.md`
