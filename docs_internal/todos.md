# PromiseKeeper — Todos (must do)

This file is intentionally short: only the work we should do next with high confidence.

## Docs and onboarding
- Write a short “PromiseKeeper in 5 minutes” quickstart (1 page): mental model + one event example + one WorldObserver example.
- Add a dedicated `occurranceKey` guide (what it means, collisions, stability recipes).

## Validation
- Verify persistence + behavior in multiplayer (where ModData lives, and what should run client vs server).
- Add one real gameplay example (not a smoke) that demonstrates a full pattern (interest → situation → promise → action).

## Tooling
- Tighten diagnostics output for “broken” promises (make the missing registration / missing situationKey case obvious).
